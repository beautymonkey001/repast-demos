This project is a curated archive of demo models and tutorials for the Repast Simphony agent simulation toolkit. We, the core Repast Developers and other select "committers," have checked the models / tutorials and if need be tweaked them to insure that they run with a specified version of repast (currently Repast 2.0). **Individual contributors are responsible for the content.**

Click [here](DemoModels.md) for the list of models, and [here](InstallInstructions.md) for install instructions.


One source of contributed models is the [cscs-repast-demos](http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos) site  which contains contributions from Google Summer of Code participants and other open source developers.  If you are interested in contributing models to the repast-demos site, please notify the developers via the [repast-interest](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/repast-interest) mailing list. Note that cscs-repast-demos is administered by Rick Riolo of the University of Michigan's   Center for the Study of Complex Systems (CSCS) and Michael North of  the Center for Complex Adaptive Agent Systems Simulation (CAS2) in the Decision and Information Sciences Division at Argonne National Laboratory.  It was started in 2011 with support from the Google Summer of Code program--thanks to Google for their support.
